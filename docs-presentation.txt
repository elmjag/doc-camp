MxCube documentation

  * build using Sphinx
  * Sphinx https://www.sphinx-doc.org/
  * markdown/reST -> HTML
  * python docs strings -> HTML


.....................

The MxCube documentation is build using Sphinx documentation generator.
See for URL to learn more about Sphinx.
We use Markdown and reStructuredText to write the docs,
and the use Sphinx to generate HTML from that.
Sphinx also extracts python doc strings and generates HTML.


---------------------

Markdown

 * lightweight markup language
 * ASCII based, human readble
 * https://commonmark.org/help/
 
  [ example md -> rendered ]

.....................

Markdown is simple markup language, you can write this easily in any text editor.
Quite popular, supported by a lot of differen systems, github, gitlab, IDEs, etc.
Fully readable as is, without rendering.
Different flavours, Sphinx is using 'commonmark', see the URL.

Markdown

[lorem ipsum example -> rendered]

.....................

Little example of markdown, and how it can be rendered.
Heading level 1, level 2, list, table, URL link.

---------------------

reStructuredText

 * Sphinx supports reStructuredText
 * *.rst is reStructuredText
 * *.md us Markdown

.....................

Sphinx supports both reStructuredText and Markdown.
We have a mix.
reStructuredText is in principle same thing as Markdown, different syntax.
Sphinx use file extension to determine if reStructuredText or Markdown
