Spring Doc Camp 2024


-------- 1 -------------

Wellcome to Doc Camp!
I'll give you a quick overview MxCube dev documentaion.
I will also talk about the technical aspects of working with the docs.

-------- 2 -------------

MxCube have developers documentation, one for web and one for core.
The docs are published to these URLs.
Quickly show web and core docs. (switch to different tabs)
This is current state of latest docs. Must expand!

New version is build and published when PR is merged.
A preview is also build when you create a new PR.

-------- 3 -------------

The MxCube documentation is build using Sphinx documentation generator.
See for URL to learn more about Sphinx.
We use Markdown and reStructuredText to write the docs,
and the use Sphinx to generate HTML from that.
Sphinx also extracts python doc strings and generates HTML.


-------- 4 -------------

Markdown is simple markup language, you can write this easily in any text editor.
Quite popular, supported by a lot of differen systems, github, gitlab, IDEs, etc.
Fully readable as is, without rendering.
Different flavours, Sphinx is using 'commonmark', see the URL.


-------- 5 -------------

This is how it can look like when Markdown is rendered.
Heading level 1, level 2, list, in-line code, URL link.

-------- 6 -------------

Sphinx supports both reStructuredText and Markdown.
reStructuredText is in principle same thing as Markdown, different syntax.
We have a mix.
Sphinx use file extension to determine if reStructuredText or Markdown
